## If you plan do anything with this, then you need to:
`npm install` - This will install everything that was used in here.
Keep in mind it will install latest version of dependencies, so something might break.

Special NPM commands: (Configure first)
1. `npm build` - to convert all .ts files into a single .js (browsers cant use .ts)
2. `npm watch` - same as build, but will convert automaticly, when detected any changes
